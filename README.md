# AMS Computer Science

The inspiration for this project came from limitations I noticed with platforms like Google Classroom, which do not allow students to see each other's work and leave feedback. This Django application allows for better student collbaoration and classroom communication.

A single student's profile page displays information like classes they are enrolled in, projects they've worked on, and recent activity on the site:

Another great feature of this app is the classroom forum. Here teachers are able to pose questions to the class and allow students to respond:
